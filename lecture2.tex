Methods to break a cipher\\

ciphertext only - just the encrypted data


\subsection{Shannon entropy}
\begin{itemize}
   \item 5 bit on average
   \item nodes on the same level in the probability tree has roughly the same probability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formal Shannon model}
       \(c = E_k(m)\)\\
       \(m = D_k(c)\)\\
       \(D_k = E_k^{-1}\)\\
