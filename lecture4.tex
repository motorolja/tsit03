Generic Block cipher

Important properties for block ciphers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Diffusion 
\item Confusion, use a none linear function for switching bits when there is a change
\end{iemize}

\textbf{DES}
Rotation of key = Least significant bit as most significant
S-boxes should not be linear functions

2 rounds know the input
3 rounds dont know the input
We can guess the XOR

Linear functions are much easier to crack

\textbf{Double DES}

Meet-in-the-middle attacks: known as a plaintext attack
Attack complexity=\(2^{57}\)

\textbf{Tripple DES}

Attack complexity=\(2^{112}\)
